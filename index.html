        <h1>Life Is Surprising</h1>
        <p> I've struggled greatly with mental health a lot for most of life. I hit a new a low last November.
            I was going through it bad. Then one day while visiting my dad I got a call. My best friend, Cody, had to get rid of his dog.
            Now I had known Cody for at least a year and this had to happen for a multitude of reasons. I gladly took in this puppy. I already loved him so much.
            I now found myself with this sweet <em>sensitive pup</em> that was also going through it bad and I had a choice either step up or let this innocent creature down. 
            He pushed me to want more. I wanted to get him the life he deserved. Now we went through our fair share of bumps in the beginning. </p>
            <h3>D-Bo's Suffers From:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Separation Anxiety </li> <br>
                <li>PTSD</li> <br>
                <li>Abandonment Issues</li> <br>
                <li>Nightmares</li> <br>
            </ul>
            <p>Now the first night was <strong>rough</strong>. If I'm completely honest neither of us slept that night; every noise scared him. 
                It definitely didn't help that I lived on the second floor in a studio. He was a trooper though and in time we made progress. He still acts surprised every time I come home.
                I still wake him up when he whines, cries, and yelps in his sleep only to hold him while talking him down. He still jumps when anyone picks up a broom or makes too sudden of a move.
                If I'm gone for too long he acts out. After everything he's been through though we are making progress.

            <h3>The Things We Conquered Together</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Stairs</li>
                <li>The Upstairs Neighbors</li>
                <li>The Car</li>
                <li>The Vinyl Floors (That one was a lot harder than you'd think)</li>
                <li>Moving 1,635 Miles Away</li>
            </ol>
            <p>With every passing day we get through a little more. Since day one it has been an uphill battle to get through our traumas and we are fighting.
