 # About Me

## Moving Around

I spent most of my **adult** life being a somewhat of a nomad going from place to place. 

| Place | Time Spent | 
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Fresno | Six months |
| Sacramento | Eight Months |
| Hanover | Five Months |
| Goodyear | One year |
| Deer Valley | One Year |

Honestly I really enjoyed Arizona which is why I stayed there so long. When leaving for this course I wanted to go back after but now I'm not so sure.

## Jobs I Picked Up Along The Way 

In my travels I ended up trying out some *interesting* jobs.

- Hosting 
- Waitressing 
- Vet Tech 
- Bartender 
- Assistant Caregiver 
- Concierge 
- Prep Cook
- Warehouse Worker
- Assistant 

The wildest job had to be the Vet Tech position because we traveled all over Arizona and got to experience a lot. A close second would be bartending because I did it first in a small hole in the wall bar then in a high end luxury retirement home which were **very** different.

### Top 3 Jobs

1. Bartender
2. Assistant Caregiver
3. Vet Tech

I never saw myself doing anything else when I first started bartending. As time passes I realized I wanted more which led me here.

Eventually I'd like to primarily be a software developer and own a small hole in the wall bar that I bartend at during my off time ~~or just drink there for free.~~
